This common folder is used to provide the entire app different modularized features and services.

Here we define 3rd party libraries as services and then set global keyword variables in the appModule to reference these libraries

In common folders, it is BEST PRACTICE to keep features as "black-box" as possible.  Try not to customize components directly for use in one particular instance.  Rather, keep the base logic and customize on an individual basis when calling the component or service.
